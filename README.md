# FindRemainingValuables

Tired of running in circles wondering if there are any more items left? No more! This mod adds a configurable threshold for leftover items, after which they will become visible on the map.

## Features
- When the remaining items outside the extraction point are under half the value of the goal, reveal every item on the map.
- Configurable threshold

## Configuration

- "RevealThreshold": Proportion of goal remaining before revealing all valuables. 0 is never, 4 is (probably) always.
